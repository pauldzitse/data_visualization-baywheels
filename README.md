# data_visualization-baywheels

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Project information

This Capstone project part of the Udacity Data Analysis Nanodegree course. It has two parts that demonstrates the importance and value of data visualization techniques within data analysis process.

I will use Python visualization libraries to systematically wrangle and explore a 2019-baywheels-tripdata datafile in part one of the project. This entails starting from ploting and visualizing of single variables and building up to ploting and visualizing multiple variables.

In part two of the project, I will produce a short presentation illustrating interesting properties, trends, and relationships that I uncover in the selected (cleaned) dataset.
1.2 Brief Dataset information and important variables

California and on the West Coast of the United States have the first regional and large-scale bicycle sharing system known as the Bay Wheels. It was established as Bay Area Bike Share in August 2013 and from January 2018, the Bay Wheels system had over 2,600 bicycles in 262 stations across San Francisco, East Bay and San Jose. The system officially re-launched on June 28, 2017 as Ford GoBike in a partnership with Ford Motor Company.

After Motivate's acquisition by Lyft, the system was subsequently renamed to Bay Wheels in June 2019. It is expected it will expand to 7,000 bicycles around 540 stations in San Francisco, Oakland, Berkeley, Emeryville, and San Jose.

The dataset consists of information on 2.506.983 bike trips, thus including its timing and geolocation of the start and end of each trips. The datasets are recorded months 2019\month_nr-baywheel-tripdata.csv. Each trip is anonymized and includes:

Trip
- Duration (seconds)
- Start Time and Date
- End Time and Date
- Start Station ID
- Start Station Name
- Start Station Latitude
- Start Station Longitude
- End Station ID
- End Station Name
- End Station Latitude
- End Station Longitude
- Bike ID
- User Type (Subscriber or Customer – “Subscriber” = Member or “Customer” = Casual)
